### Imputation Process Documentation

#### 1. Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the imputation process performed on the dataset.
The goal of this step was to **fill missing values** in the column `Verlauf_entspricht_NBE` while ensuring
that all imputed values remain binary (`0` or `1`).

#### 2. Data Loading & Filtering
- The raw dataset was loaded from the file specified in the `.env` variable `BASE_DATASET`.
- Initial dataset shape: **(3662, 8)**
- Filtering applied:
  - Removed rows where `Telefonat` was `2` or `4`.
- Filtered dataset shape: **(3427, 8)**
- Missing values before imputation:
  - `Verlauf_entspricht_NBE`: **295 missing values**.

#### 3. Imputation Methods Applied
Each of the following imputation methods was applied, and missing values were filled:

| Method       | Missing Values After | Unique Values After |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Mean        | 0                   | [0.77618135, 1.0, 0.0] ❌ |
| Median      | 0                   | [1.0, 0.0] ✅ |
| Mode        | 0                   | [1.0, 0.0] ✅ |
| KNN         | 0                   | [1, 0] ✅ |
| Hot-Deck    | 0                   | [1.0, 0.0] ✅ |
| Autoencoder | 0                   | [1, 0] ✅ |

#### 4. Evaluation Process
- A **frequency distribution plot** was generated for each imputation method.
- The plot was saved in the output directory:
  - `OUTPUT_FOLDER/plots/step1/imputation_evaluation.png`

#### 5. Best Imputation Method Selection
**Criteria:**
- The best imputation method must retain only binary values (`0` or `1`).
- The method should closely match the original data distribution.

**Results:**
- **Mean imputation introduced a non-binary value (0.77618135) → Disqualified.**
- **KNN, Autoencoder, Median, Mode, and Hot-Deck retained only binary values → Valid choices.**
- **Median was initially selected as the best method.**
- **However, KNN or Autoencoder is an equally valid alternative if the closest match to original data is preferred.**

#### 6. Log Information
A complete log of the process was saved in:
  - `LOG_FOLDER/step1/ingestion_preprocessing_log.txt`

#### 7. Next Steps
- The dataset imputed with **KNN, Autoencoder, or Median** should be used for further analysis.
- If validation against external benchmarks is available, compare results.

#### 8. Summary
✅ **Imputation completed successfully.**  
✅ **Missing values were handled correctly.**  
✅ **Binary constraints were maintained.**  
✅ **Final recommendation: Use KNN or Autoencoder for best results.**
