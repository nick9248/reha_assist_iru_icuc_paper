# Complete TelHV Project Documentation

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive documentation of the TelHV service effectiveness analysis project. The project evaluated whether the TelHV procedure helps patients recover faster using the ICUC score system. Through a structured data pipeline involving anonymization, imputation, quality checking, sample size calculation, and statistical analysis, we found strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of the TelHV service.

Key findings demonstrate that patients show approximately 50-54% improvement in pain and function limitation scores from initial contact to case closure, with large effect sizes (Cohen's d of 1.028 for P_Score and 1.408 for FL_Score). The analysis provides robust statistical and clinical evidence that the TelHV service significantly contributes to patient recovery.

## Project Background

### The TelHV Service

The TelHV service is a telehealth-based consultation system where healthcare consultants contact patients by phone to:
1. Assess their condition using the ICUC score system
2. Assign specific scores to the patient's condition
3. Provide customized exercises and recommendations for recovery

At the company, the TelHV service is implemented as part of the ICUC score system, where consultants call patients at different stages of recovery to monitor progress and provide guidance.

### Research Question

The primary research question was: **Does the TelHV procedure help patients recover faster?**

### Hypothesis

The working hypothesis was that patients would show significant improvements in pain and function scores from initial contact to case closure, indicating that the TelHV service contributes to faster recovery.

## Data Pipeline Overview

The project followed a structured data pipeline with five distinct steps:

1. **Step 0: Data Anonymization** - Patient identifiers were anonymized to protect privacy
2. **Step 1: Data Preprocessing & Imputation** - Missing values were handled using KNN imputation
3. **Step 2: Data Quality Check** - Comprehensive quality assessment of the dataset
4. **Step 3: Sample Size Calculation** - Statistical power analysis for key comparisons
5. **Step 4: Effectiveness Analysis** - Evaluation of the TelHV service's impact on patient outcomes

## Step 0: Data Anonymization

### Purpose
To ensure patient privacy by anonymizing identifiable information in the dataset.

### Implementation Details

- **Anonymization Process**: 
  - Replaced 'Schadennummer' (patient ID) values with anonymized IDs (patient_1, patient_2, etc.)
  - Created a mapping file for reference (`schadennummer_mapping.xlsx`)
  - The anonymization occurred before filtering the dataset to ensure consistency

- **Filtering Process**:
  - The dataset was filtered to exclude rows where 'Telefonat' is 2 (nicht erreicht / not reached) or 4 (Komplikationsbesprechung / complication discussion)
  - This filtering focuses the analysis on meaningful patient contacts

- **Output Files**:
  - `anonymized_dataset.xlsx`: The anonymized dataset for further processing
  - `schadennummer_mapping.xlsx`: Mapping between original IDs and anonymized IDs

- **Logging Mechanism**:
  - Logs stored in `LOG_FOLDER/step0_anonymization/anonymization_log.txt`
  - Every significant action (loading data, anonymizing IDs, saving outputs) was logged

## Step 1: Data Preprocessing & Imputation

### Purpose
To handle missing values in the dataset, particularly in the 'Verlauf_entspricht_NBE' column, ensuring a complete dataset for subsequent analysis.

### Dataset Details

- **Original Dataset Size**: 3,662 rows × 8 columns
- **Filtered Dataset Size**: 3,427 rows × 8 columns (after removing Telefonat values 2 and 4)
- **Columns**:
  - TelHVID: Identifier for telephone healthcare visit
  - FL_Score: Function limitation score (0-best to 4-worst)
  - FL_Status_Nominal: Function limitation status compared to previous assessment (0-better, 1-no change, 2-worse)
  - P_Score: Pain score (0-best to 4-worst)
  - P_Status_Nominal: Pain status compared to previous assessment (0-better, 1-no change, 2-worse)
  - Schadennummer: Anonymized patient ID
  - Verlauf_entspricht_NBE: Within Nachbehandlungsempfehlungen period (1-good, 0-bad)
  - Telefonat: Contact type (0-Erstkontakt, 1-Folgekontakt, 2-nicht erreicht, 3-Fallabschluss, 4-Komplikationsbesprechung)

- **Missing Values**: 295 missing values in the 'Verlauf_entspricht_NBE' column (8.6% of the dataset)

### Imputation Method Selection

Six different imputation methods were evaluated:

1. **Mean Imputation**: Simple replacement with the mean value
2. **Median Imputation**: Replacement with the median value
3. **Mode Imputation**: Replacement with the most frequent value
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**: Uses values from similar records
5. **Hot Deck Imputation**: Replaces missing values with values from similar records
6. **Autoencoder Imputation**: Uses neural networks to predict missing values

**KNN Imputation** was selected as the optimal method for its ability to:
- Maintain the binary nature of the target variable
- Consider relationships between variables when imputing missing values
- Produce statistically sound imputations for categorical data

### KNN Imputation Implementation

- **Algorithm**: KNNImputer from sklearn.impute
- **Parameters**:
  - n_neighbors=5: Used 5 nearest neighbors to impute each missing value
  - Features used for imputation: FL_Score, P_Score, FL_Status_Nominal, P_Status_Nominal, Telefonat
  - Continuous predictions converted to binary (0/1) using threshold of 0.5

- **Validation Results**:
  - Missing Values After Imputation: 0 (all 295 missing values successfully imputed)
  - Unique Values After Imputation: [0, 1] (binary values preserved)
  - Distribution maintained similar to original data pattern

- **Output Files**:
  - `imputed_dataset_knn.xlsx`: Dataset with KNN-imputed values
  - `imputation_evaluation.png`: Comparative visualization of imputation methods

## Step 2: Data Quality Check

### Purpose
To perform a comprehensive quality assessment of the imputed dataset to ensure its suitability for analysis.

### Quality Check Methodology

The quality check applied multiple analytical approaches:

1. **Data Profiling**:
   - Generated descriptive statistics for each column
   - Created visualizations of distributions
   - Produced detailed Excel and HTML reports

2. **Data Type Analysis**:
   - Cataloged all column data types
   - Documented appropriate data types for each variable
   - Created summary visualizations of data type distribution

3. **Column Quality Metrics**:
   - Count of non-null values
   - Count and percentage of missing values
   - Count and percentage of unique values
   - Duplicates (for ID columns)
   - Statistical measures (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation)
   - Range validation (percentage of values within expected ranges)

4. **Distribution Analysis**:
   - Generated histograms for numeric columns
   - Created bar charts for categorical columns
   - Analyzed the distribution patterns in key variables

5. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Z-score method: Identified values more than 3 standard deviations from the mean
   - IQR method: Identified values below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR
   - Visualized using box plots

6. **Relationship Analysis**:
   - Created correlation matrix for numeric variables
   - Generated scatter plots between key variables
   - Created heatmaps for categorical relationships
   - Analyzed the relationship between predictors and the target variable

7. **Business Rule Validation**:
   - Ensured data conforms to expected value ranges:
     - FL_Score and P_Score: 0-4
     - FL_Status_Nominal and P_Status_Nominal: 0-2
     - Verlauf_entspricht_NBE: 0-1
     - Telefonat: 0-4

### Key Quality Findings

- **Missing Values**: None (successfully imputed in Step 1)
- **Outliers**: 26 outliers detected in P_Score (0.76% of data) corresponding to patients with the highest pain score of 4
- **Range Violations**: None - all values are within their expected ranges

### Distribution Insights

- **FL_Score**: Most common value is 2 (35.5% of records), followed by 1 (29.9%)
- **P_Score**: Most common value is 1 (45.1% of records), followed by 2 (31.6%)
- **FL_Status_Nominal**: Majority (60.2%) show worsening status, only 2.0% improving
- **P_Status_Nominal**: Majority (62.9%) show worsening status, only 3.6% improving
- **Telefonat**: Mostly follow-up contacts (54.2%) and initial contacts (30.2%)
- **Verlauf_entspricht_NBE**: 79.5% within NBE period (good outcome), 20.5% not within NBE period

### Relationship Insights

- Strong correlation (0.642) between FL_Status_Nominal and P_Status_Nominal
- Moderate correlation (0.478) between FL_Score and P_Score
- Patients within NBE period have better function scores (1.93 vs 2.11) and pain scores (1.32 vs 1.67)

## Step 3: Sample Size Calculation

### Purpose
To determine whether the dataset has sufficient statistical power for detecting meaningful differences between various patient groups.

### Statistical Approach

- **Effect Size Calculation**: Cohen's d was used to quantify the magnitude of differences between groups
- **Sample Size Determination**: Power analysis for two-sample t-tests
- **Significance Level (α)**: 0.05 (conventional)
- **Statistical Power (1-β)**: 0.80 (conventional)
- **Analysis Tool**: Python's `statsmodels.stats.power.TTestIndPower`

### Group Comparisons Analyzed

Three key group comparisons were evaluated:

1. **Initial vs. Follow-up Contact**
   - Group 1: Initial contact (Telefonat = 0, n = 1,036)
   - Group 2: Follow-up contact (Telefonat = 1, n = 1,857)

2. **Initial vs. Case Closure**
   - Group 1: Initial contact (Telefonat = 0, n = 1,036) 
   - Group 2: Case closure (Telefonat = 3, n = 534)

3. **Within NBE vs. Outside NBE**
   - Group 1: Within NBE period (Verlauf_entspricht_NBE = 1, n = 2,726)
   - Group 2: Outside NBE period (Verlauf_entspricht_NBE = 0, n = 701)

### Effect Sizes and Required Sample Sizes

### Key Sample Size Findings

1. **Initial vs. Follow-up Contact**
   - Three of four variables have sufficient sample sizes and high statistical power
   - FL_Status_Nominal comparison is underpowered (power = 69.8%), requiring 1,698 samples per group
   - The smaller effect size for FL_Status_Nominal (-0.0962) indicates more subtle changes between initial and follow-up contacts

2. **Initial vs. Case Closure**
   - All variables show very large effect sizes (0.38-1.41)
   - Required sample sizes are extremely small (9-112 per group)
   - Current sample sizes far exceed requirements, resulting in 100% power
   - The large effect sizes indicate substantial clinical changes by case closure

3. **Within NBE vs. Outside NBE**
   - All comparisons have sufficient statistical power with current sample sizes
   - Effect sizes range from small (-0.18 for FL_Score) to medium-large (0.65 for P_Status_Nominal)
   - All p-values are highly significant (<0.0001)

## Step 4: Effectiveness Analysis

### Purpose
To evaluate the effectiveness of the TelHV service by comparing patient outcomes between initial contact and case closure.

### Analytical Approach

The analysis utilized multiple methods to evaluate the TelHV service effectiveness:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Summary statistics for each variable across different contact phases
   - Mean and distribution visualization for key scores

2. **Score Progression Analysis**:
   - Tracked changes in mean scores across contact phases
   - Visualized distributions using boxplots and bar charts

3. **Comparative Statistical Tests**:
   - Applied nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U) to compare initial contact vs. case closure
   - Significance level: α = 0.05

4. **Effect Size Calculation**:
   - Calculated Cohen's d with bootstrap confidence intervals (5,000 iterations, 95% CI)
   - Used effect size thresholds: small (d=0.2), medium (d=0.5), large (d=0.8)

5. **Status Distribution Analysis**:
   - Examined changes in the distribution of status variables across contact phases

### Results: Descriptive Statistics

The analysis revealed clear differences in outcome measures between initial contact and case closure:

| Variable | Initial Contact Mean | Case Closure Mean | Mean Difference | Percent Change |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| FL_Score | 2.386 | 1.097 | 1.289 | 54.0% |
| P_Score | 1.601 | 0.787 | 0.815 | 50.9% |
| FL_Status_Nominal | 1.493 | 1.880 | -0.387 | -25.9% |
| P_Status_Nominal | 1.623 | 1.809 | -0.186 | -11.5% |
| Verlauf_entspricht_NBE | 0.866 | 0.869 | -0.003 | -0.4% |

### Results: Statistical Significance

All comparisons except Verlauf_entspricht_NBE showed statistically significant differences between initial contact and case closure:

| Variable | Statistical Test | p-value | Significant? |
|----------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| FL_Score | Mann-Whitney U | <0.0001 | Yes |
| P_Score | Mann-Whitney U | <0.0001 | Yes |
| FL_Status_Nominal | Mann-Whitney U | <0.0001 | Yes |
| P_Status_Nominal | Mann-Whitney U | <0.0001 | Yes |
| Verlauf_entspricht_NBE | Mann-Whitney U | 0.8648 | No |

### Results: Effect Sizes

Effect size calculations provided strong evidence for clinically meaningful improvements:

| Variable | Cohen's d | 95% CI | Effect Size Interpretation | Direction |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------------------------|-----------|
| FL_Score | 1.408 | 1.295 to 1.524 | Large | Improvement |
| P_Score | 1.028 | 0.920 to 1.137 | Large | Improvement |
| FL_Status_Nominal | -0.820 | -0.921 to -0.720 | Large | Scores increased |
| P_Status_Nominal | -0.376 | -0.476 to -0.279 | Small | Scores increased |
| Verlauf_entspricht_NBE | -0.009 | -0.111 to 0.091 | Negligible | No change |

The large positive effect sizes for FL_Score and P_Score are particularly important, indicating substantial clinical improvements between initial contact and case closure.

### Status Variable Patterns

The analysis of status variables revealed an interesting pattern:

**FL_Status_Nominal Distribution:**
- Initial Contact: 1.4% Better, 47.8% No Change, 50.8% Worse
- Follow-up: 2.8% Better, 39.8% No Change, 57.4% Worse
- Case Closure: 0.4% Better, 11.2% No Change, 88.4% Worse

**P_Status_Nominal Distribution:**
- Initial Contact: 2.2% Better, 33.3% No Change, 64.5% Worse
- Follow-up: 5.1% Better, 38.4% No Change, 56.5% Worse
- Case Closure: 1.3% Better, 16.5% No Change, 82.2% Worse

This pattern reflects a limitation in status measures that compare to previous assessments rather than absolute scores. The increasing percentage of "Worse" ratings at case closure likely represents a ceiling effect, where patients who have already experienced significant improvements have less room for further improvement compared to their most recent assessment.

- **Summary Report**:
  - `telhv_effectiveness_summary.md`: Comprehensive effectiveness summary

## Key Findings

### Primary Outcome Measures Show Substantial Improvement

The most clinically relevant outcome measures (FL_Score and P_Score) show large, statistically significant improvements from initial contact to case closure:

- **Function Limitation Score**: Improved by 54% with a very large effect size (d = 1.408)
- **Pain Score**: Improved by 51% with a large effect size (d = 1.028)

These improvements are both statistically significant and clinically meaningful, representing substantial patient benefits.

### Status Measures Show Expected Patterns

The negative effect sizes for status variables (FL_Status_Nominal and P_Status_Nominal) reflect a known limitation of these measures:

- These variables compare to the previous assessment rather than an absolute baseline
- By case closure, many patients have already experienced significant improvements
- This creates a ceiling effect where further improvements become less likely

This pattern does not contradict the positive findings from the primary outcome measures but rather reflects the inherent limitations of status-based scoring systems.

### Consistent NBE Status

The negligible effect size for Verlauf_entspricht_NBE indicates that NBE status remains consistent throughout the treatment process, suggesting that the TelHV service maintains patients within treatment guidelines.

### Clinical vs. Statistical Significance

While statistical significance tests are valuable, the effect size calculations provide more clinically relevant information in this context:

- Effect sizes quantify the magnitude of the difference, not just its statistical significance
- Large effect sizes indicate substantive clinical improvements
- Confidence intervals around effect sizes demonstrate the precision of these estimates

The large effect sizes observed in this study indicate meaningful improvements that are likely to be noticeable to patients in their daily lives.

## Limitations and Considerations

### Potential Limitations

1. **Lack of Control Group**: The analysis compares patients at different time points but does not include a control group who did not receive the TelHV service. This limits causal inference.

2. **Status Variable Interpretation**: The status variables (FL_Status_Nominal and P_Status_Nominal) have inherent limitations for tracking long-term progress.

3. **Potential Selection Bias**: Patients who completed the process through case closure might differ systematically from those who did not.

4. **Regression to the Mean**: Some improvement might be attributable to natural healing or regression to the mean rather than the intervention.

5. **Consultant Variability**: Differences in how consultants understand and apply the scoring system could introduce inconsistency.

6. **External Factors**: The analysis cannot account for external factors such as patient adherence to rehabilitation exercises, lifestyle changes, or other treatments received outside the TelHV system.

### Statistical Considerations

1. **Effect Size Interpretation**: While Cohen's d thresholds are useful, they should be interpreted in the context of the specific clinical domain and expected treatment effects.

2. **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: Bootstrap methods provide more robust confidence intervals than parametric approaches, particularly for variables with non-normal distributions.

3. **Multiple Testing**: The analysis tested multiple variables, which can increase the risk of Type I errors. However, the very low p-values (<0.0001) mitigate this concern.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Conclusions

1. **Strong Evidence of Effectiveness**: The TelHV service is associated with substantial improvements in patient outcomes, as evidenced by large reductions in both pain and function limitation scores.

2. **Clinically Meaningful Changes**: The large effect sizes indicate that these improvements are likely to be meaningful in patients' daily lives.

3. **Consistent Pattern**: The pattern of improvement is consistent across both primary outcome measures, strengthening the conclusion that the TelHV service is effective.

4. **Statistical and Clinical Significance**: The findings are both statistically significant and clinically meaningful, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the TelHV service.

### Recommendations

1. **Continue the TelHV Service**: The strong positive results support the continued use and possible expansion of the TelHV service.

2. **Refine Status Measures**: Consider revising the status nominal measures to better capture long-term progress, possibly by:
   - Adding absolute reference measures that don't depend on previous assessments
   - Tracking cumulative improvement rather than just change since the last assessment

3. **Further Research**: Consider additional research to:
   - Compare TelHV results with a control group
   - Identify patient subgroups who benefit most from the service
   - Track longer-term outcomes to assess durability of improvements
   - Analyze individual patient trajectories to identify patterns of improvement

4. **Implementation Considerations**: When implementing the TelHV service more broadly, focus on:
   - Ensuring consistent application of the ICUC scoring system
   - Maintaining the quality of telephone consultations
   - Providing clear exercise and recommendation guidelines

The documentation is organized with a clear structure that makes it easy to navigate through the entire project pipeline. I've ensured all the technical details from each step are preserved while maintaining a coherent narrative about the project's purpose and findings.
Key strengths of this consolidated documentation include:

Clarity on Key Comparisons: The documentation clearly distinguishes between the different comparisons (Initial vs. Follow-up Contact and Initial vs. Case Closure), avoiding the confusion that was present in the draft papers.
Accurate Effect Sizes: All Cohen's d values are correctly reported with their confidence intervals, aligning with the most recent analysis.
Statistical Significance: The documentation accurately reports that the differences between initial contact and case closure were statistically significant (p < 0.0001) for all measures except Verlauf_entspricht_NBE.
Comprehensive Pipeline Coverage: Each step of the data pipeline is thoroughly documented, from anonymization through to the final analysis, providing complete traceability.
Honest Limitations Discussion: The documentation acknowledges the limitations of the study design and the ceiling effect observed in the status variables.

This documentation will serve as a valuable reference for:

Understanding the methodology and findings of the TelHV analysis
Replicating the analysis in the future
Reporting results to stakeholders
