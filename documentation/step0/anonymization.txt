# Data Anonymization and Preprocessing Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a detailed explanation of the anonymization and preprocessing process applied to the dataset.

## Steps Performed

### **1. Loading Dataset**
- The dataset is loaded from the path specified in the `.env` variable `BASE_DATASET`.
- The initial dataset shape is logged before any modifications.

### **2. Anonymization of `Schadennummer`**
- `Schadennummer` (patient ID) is anonymized for data privacy.
- Each unique `Schadennummer` is mapped to an anonymized label such as `patient_1`, `patient_2`, etc.
- The mapping is saved in an Excel file named `schadennummer_mapping.xlsx`.

#### **Key Details:**
- **Mapping Process:** Each unique `Schadennummer` is assigned a unique anonymized ID.
- **Mapping File Location:** `step0_anonymization/schadennummer_mapping.xlsx`
- **Before Filtering:** The anonymization occurs **before** filtering the dataset to ensure consistency.

### **3. Saving Anonymized Dataset**
- The dataset with anonymized `Schadennummer` is saved as `anonymized_dataset.xlsx` in the directory `step0_anonymization`.

### **4. Filtering Data**
- The dataset is filtered to exclude rows where `Telefonat` is `2` or `4`.
- This filtering step occurs **after** the anonymization.

### **5. Logging Mechanism**
- Logging is implemented for tracking all steps.
- Logs are stored in different locations for clarity:
  - **Anonymization logs:** `LOG_FOLDER/step0_anonymization/anonymization_log.txt`
  - **Preprocessing logs:** `LOG_FOLDER/step1/ingestion_preprocessing_log.txt`
- Every significant action (loading data, anonymizing IDs, saving outputs) is logged.

### **6. Handling of Directories and File Paths**
- **Output Folders:**
  - `step0_anonymization/` for anonymized data and mappings.
  - `step1/` for further preprocessing steps.
- **Ensuring Directories Exist:** `os.makedirs()` is used to create necessary folders.

### **7. Fixes and Improvements**
- **Fixed `SettingWithCopyWarning`**: Used `.loc[:, "Schadennummer"]` to modify DataFrame safely.
- **Fixed File Path Issue:** Ensured `step0_anonymization` is correctly placed under the **directory** of `BASE_DATASET`, not inside the file itself.
- **Step-specific Logs:** Separated log files by step (`step0_anonymization` for anonymization and `step1` for preprocessing).

### **8. Key Files and Their Locations**
| File | Description | Location |
|------|------------|----------|
| `anonymized_dataset.xlsx` | Dataset with anonymized `Schadennummer` | `step0_anonymization/` |
| `schadennummer_mapping.xlsx` | Mapping of original `Schadennummer` to anonymized IDs | `step0_anonymization/` |
| `anonymization_log.txt` | Logs for anonymization process | `LOG_FOLDER/step0_anonymization/` |
| `ingestion_preprocessing_log.txt` | Logs for preprocessing steps | `LOG_FOLDER/step1/` |

## **Summary**
âœ… **Anonymization of `Schadennummer` completed successfully.**  
âœ… **Dataset is anonymized *before* filtering.**  
âœ… **Logging implemented in step-specific directories.**  
âœ… **Directories are correctly structured.**  
âœ… **`SettingWithCopyWarning` and `FileNotFoundError` issues resolved.**  

This documentation covers all the steps, discussions, and fixes applied to ensure data privacy and proper preprocessing.
