# TelHV Effectiveness Analysis Summary Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the analysis of the TelHV service effectiveness using the ICUC score system. 
The analysis compares patient scores at initial contact and case closure to determine if 
the TelHV procedure helps patients get better faster.

## Key Findings

### FL_Score (Function limitation score (0-best to 4-worst))

- Initial Contact mean: 2.386
- Case Closure mean: 1.097
- Mean difference: 1.289
- Percent change: 54.0%

- The difference is statistically significant (p = 0.0000).
- Cohen's d: 1.408 (95% CI: 1.295 to 1.524)
- Effect size interpretation: Large
- Direction: Improvement (scores decreased)

### P_Score (Pain score (0-best to 4-worst))

- Initial Contact mean: 1.601
- Case Closure mean: 0.787
- Mean difference: 0.815
- Percent change: 50.9%

- The difference is statistically significant (p = 0.0000).
- Cohen's d: 1.028 (95% CI: 0.920 to 1.137)
- Effect size interpretation: Large
- Direction: Improvement (scores decreased)

### FL_Status_Nominal (Function limitation status compared to previous assessment (0-better, 1-no change, 2-worse))

- Initial Contact mean: 1.493
- Case Closure mean: 1.880
- Mean difference: -0.387
- Percent change: -25.9%

- The difference is statistically significant (p = 0.0000).
- Cohen's d: -0.820 (95% CI: -0.921 to -0.720)
- Effect size interpretation: Large
- Direction: Scores increased

### P_Status_Nominal (Pain status compared to previous assessment (0-better, 1-no change, 2-worse))

- Initial Contact mean: 1.623
- Case Closure mean: 1.809
- Mean difference: -0.186
- Percent change: -11.5%

- The difference is statistically significant (p = 0.0000).
- Cohen's d: -0.376 (95% CI: -0.476 to -0.279)
- Effect size interpretation: Small
- Direction: Scores increased

### Verlauf_entspricht_NBE (Within Nachbehandlungsempfehlungen period (1-good, 0-bad))

- Initial Contact mean: 0.866
- Case Closure mean: 0.869
- Mean difference: -0.003
- Percent change: -0.4%

- The difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.8648).
- Cohen's d: -0.009 (95% CI: -0.111 to 0.091)
- Effect size interpretation: Negligible
- Direction: Scores increased

## Overall Interpretation

The analysis shows that the TelHV service has a positive effect on patient outcomes. 
Both pain scores and function limitation scores improved between initial contact and case closure. 
The analysis found 3 variables with large effect sizes, 
indicating substantial clinical changes despite some differences not reaching statistical significance. 
This highlights the importance of considering effect sizes in clinical research, 
as small sample sizes may not provide sufficient statistical power to detect significant differences, 
but the observed effects may still be clinically meaningful.

## Conclusion

Based on Cohen's d effect sizes, which are particularly valuable in medical and real-world procedures, 
the TelHV service appears to be effective in improving patient outcomes. 
While statistical significance tests might not always show differences, 
the effect sizes indicate meaningful clinical improvements between initial contact and case closure.

The analysis supports the hypothesis that the TelHV procedure helps patients get better faster, 
as evidenced by improvements in both pain and function limitation scores. 
The ICUC score system has successfully captured these improvements, 
demonstrating the value of the TelHV service in patient care.
